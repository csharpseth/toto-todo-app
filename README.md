## Prerequisites:

In order to launch this application first create an 'ignore.js' file that exports a LOCAL_ADDRESS variable like so:
```javascript
  export const LOCAL_ADDRESS = 'YOUR LOCAL IP HERE'
```
Next, you will need to run the following command in both the 'Frontend' & 'Backend' folders:
```bash
  npm install
```
Now you can either install the ExpoGo app on your phone or use an emulator to run the app. I went with ExpoGo on my iPhone SE

## Execution

Finally, we can run the application start by opening the 'Backend' directory in a command line and running:
```bash
  npm run dev
```
Next go into the 'Frontend' directory in a separate command line and running:
```bash
  npm start
```
Now You should be able to scan the QR code on your phone or follow the other procedures it gives you to run an emulator.
